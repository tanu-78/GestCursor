# GestCursor
Overview
Welcome to GestCursor, a virtual mouse project that allows users to control their computer's cursor using hand gestures. This project leverages computer vision and gesture recognition technologies to provide an intuitive and hands-free way to interact with your computer.

Features
Gesture Recognition: GestCursor uses advanced gesture recognition algorithms to accurately interpret hand movements and translate them into cursor actions.

Virtual Mouse Control: Navigate your computer screen effortlessly without the need for a physical mouse. GestCursor provides a virtual mouse experience, making it particularly useful for scenarios where traditional input devices are not convenient or accessible.

Customizable Gestures: Tailor the gesture recognition system to your preferences. Define your own set of gestures for specific actions, such as clicking, dragging, scrolling, and more.

User-friendly Interface: The project includes a simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to configure settings, calibrate gestures, and monitor the system's performance.
